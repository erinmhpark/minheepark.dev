        In the last seven years, I worked as a business developer and a founder
        in the mobile game and the blockchain industry. Working with startup
        founders and consistently learning new technologies eventually led me to
        follow the path of a builder. I&apos;m currently studying for a
        master&apos;s at Northeastern to specialize in smart-contract
        engineering.

        I love playing games! When I learned to program for the time, my first
        project was building a game in C++. I&apos;m working on a game to
        incentivize people who spend less time in front of computers. Stay
        tuned!
